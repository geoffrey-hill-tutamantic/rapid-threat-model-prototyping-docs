# Rapid Threat Model Prototyping (RTMP) documents
This repository stores content that can be used to design a Rapid Threat Model Prototyping (RTMP) process for a software development group. The repository will contain process documents and eventually helper code to implement the RTMP process.

RTMP is a threat modelling technique that decreases the time to make a threat model while also enabling the process to become more streamlined and effective. The methodology lends itself to automation and inclusion in an Agile or DevOps workflow.

8. 19h20.mar.mapping table - STRIDE-OT10-CWE-OPC-ASVS.xlsx
   * This sheet will help a team to map the STRIDE threats to other frameworks to either find more specific threats or to find mitigations. This enables a team to not have the burden of maintaining Threat and Security Mitigation libraries.These are now based on the standard OWASP mitigation libraries.
